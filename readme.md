# color-term: colorify your terminal

![demo](https://i.imgur.com/wZBlEP8.gif)

### quick start:

 - Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/pvtmert/color-term.git`

 - Edit `list.txt` to include color you want

 - Execute `make` in the directory, `make -j4` for 4 parallel downloads.

 - In the profile preferences of your Terminal.app, select **directory** as background.

### add custom colors:

 either:

 - add 6 digit hex color code to `list.txt`, run `make` again.

 - or run `make {color}.jpg` with your 6 digit hex color code, eg: `make 223344.jpg`
