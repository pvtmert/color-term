 - Edit `list.txt` to include color you want

 - Execute `make` in the directory, `make -j4` for 4 parallel downloads.

 - In the preferences of your Terminal.app, select **directory** as background.

### add custom colors

 - to `list.txt`, run `make` again.

 - or run `make {color}.jpg` eg: `make 223344.jpg`
